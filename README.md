Hi my name is Ryan Thomas and I am currently a Software Engineering Student at University Nebraska Lincoln. 

I'm currently learning react/redux javascript in SOFT 260 and will hopefully be learning unity in the UNL game development club.

Most of the stuff on this github account is some simple IOS stuff I did in high school, except for the MGG games repo is a java project I did last semester for CSCE 156.
