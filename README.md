Hi my name is Ryan Thomas and I am currently a Software Engineering Student at University Nebraska Lincoln. 

I'm currently learning C# and the .NET framework in my senior design project working with the USDA.

Most of the stuff on this github account is some simple IOS stuff I did in high school, except for the MGG games repo is a java project I did in a previous semester for CSCE 156.
